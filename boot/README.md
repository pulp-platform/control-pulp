# Control PULP - Boot

## Boot code

The PMS bootcode is hosted in this directory. An `RTL/ASIC` and `FPGA` SystemVerilog boot ROMs are **auto-generated** from the compiled boot code.
The autogenerated ASIC boot ROM can be found under:

```
ips/pulp_soc/rtl/pulp_soc/asic_autogen_rom.sv
```

It's size is currently 8KiB (32 x 2048 bits).

## Boot modes

Currently there are 2 bits available to select the boot mode.

| `bootsel` value | Meaning                                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 2'h0          | default boot (to be determined)                       |
| 2'h1          | JTAG boot for openocd (busy loop)                     |
| 2'h2          | QSPI boot (read from flash and jump to entry)         |
| 2'h3          | preloaded boot (jump to address in bootaddr register) |


## Default Boot
To be determined

## JTAG Boot
In this mode we just send the fabric controller into a busy loop. The debug
module then can take it from there. It will sent a debug request interrupt that
redirect the control flow of the core to the debug rom.

## QSPI Boot
The core will issue a series of commands to fetch the elf from a flash module
attached to qspi. Afterwards it will jump to the entry point (information is
also in the flash image).

## Preloaded Boot
The cores will read the boot address register and directly jump there.
This assumes that the elf image has been written to the L2 previously and the
boot address is set correctly.
